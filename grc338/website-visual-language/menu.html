               conditions, such as dark corners of offices and homes. A workhorse of a houseplant, 
               the ZZ can tolerate periods of drought, so water when top 2 inches of the soil is dry.</p>

                but it is still easy to grow. It does like the temperature on the warm side, so avoid placing 
                it near windows with cold drafts or A/C vents. Water when soil is dry.</p>

               at filtering the air, it’s a great pick for bedrooms and office spaces. Place in bright 
               light and water when soil is dry or leaves start to droop. (Don’t worry, they’ll spring 
               right back up.)</p>

            <p class="description">Philos are also great at communicating with their parents, so 
               if you’re paying attention your plant will tell you what it needs. There also might be 
               more maintenance in the form of pruning, as Philos are fast growers and if you choose a 
               vining variety, you might have to keep their lengthy vines in check.</p>

            <h4>Moth Orchid</h4>
            <p class="description">Being a plant parent to moth orchids (also called Phalaenopsis) requires 
               some patience. After blooming, these plants need time to regenerate before putting out another 
               round of flowers. An orchid will drop its previous blooms 
               so it can give all its energy to new flowers.</p>

               these tropical beauties can be somewhat fussy about their treatment. For starters, they don't 
               like sudden changes when you move them from one spot to another.</p>

               These trailing plants are perfect for displaying in macramé plant hangers,
               but you can also just keep them in regular containers.</p>

            <h4>Inch plant</h4>
            <p class="description">Its vining growth habit is both a gift and a curse for the inch plant. 
               In a hanging basket, the distinctive, purple-and-silver-striped leaves gently cascade down, 
               glistening in the light and looking beautiful. Over time, as the tendrils get longer and the 
               leaves get fewer and farther
               in between, an inch plant begins to look sickly, even if it’s thriving</p>

            <h4>Zebra Plant</h4>
            <p class="description">Many plant enthusiasts admire zebra plants for their glossy white-veined leaves, 
               golden flower bracts, and yellow blooms, but the showy houseplants require tediously specific growing
                conditions. Those caring for a zebra plant should keep their house around 70 degrees Fahrenheit year round, and position the plant near a brightly lit window that receives no direct sunlight.</p>

                but it’s a fussy green to maintain. The perennial houseplant, which is often erroneously referred 
                to as a tree, requires tropical conditions to survive. To keep your banana plant happy,
